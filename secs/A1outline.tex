\section{Outline}\label{sec:Outline}
\subsection*{Topic of the Paper}
The paper looks at hybrid fluid simulations, which combine 
traditional simulation methods with modern deep learning techniques. 
It aims to 
explore how integrating numerical stability, computational accuracy, and real-time 
prediction capabilities can be enhanced by merging classical fluid dynamics 
simulations (such as Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), Large Eddy Simulation 
(LES), and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)) with advanced machine learning 
techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Fourier Neural Operators 
(FNOs), and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
