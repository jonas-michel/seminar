  abstract = {High-fidelity models of multiphysics fluid flow processes are often computationally expensive. On the other hand, less accurate low-fidelity models could be efficiently executed to provide an approximation to the solution. Multi-fidelity approaches combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data and/or models to obtain a desirable balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. In this manuscript, we propose a multi-fidelity approach where we combine data generated by a low-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solution strategy (solver settings and resolution) and data-free physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to obtain improved accuracy. Specifically, transfer learning based on low-fidelity CFD data is used to initialize PINN. Subsequently, PINN with this physics-guided initialization is used to obtain the final results without any high-fidelity training data. The accuracy of the final results relies on the governing equations encoded in PINN together with the low-fidelity CFD data initialization. To investigate the accuracy of this approach, several partial differential equations were solved to predict velocity and temperature in different fluid flow, heat transfer, and porous media transport problems. Comparison with reference high-fidelity CFD data revealed that the proposed approach not only significantly improves the accuracy of low-fidelity CFD data but also improves the convergence speed and accuracy of PINN.},

  abstract = {Solving complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, which are described by nonlinear partial differential equations, is crucial in various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational fluid dynamics based solvers are inadequate to handle the increasing demand for large-scale and long-period simulations. The ever-increasing availability of data and rapid advancement in deep learning (DL) have opened new avenues to tackle these challenges through data-enabled modeling. The seamless integration of DL and classic numerical techniques through the differentiable programming framework can significantly improve data-driven modeling performance. In this study, we propose a differentiable hybrid neural modeling framework for efficient simulation of FSI problems, where the numerically discretized FSI physics based on the immersed boundary method is seamlessly integrated with sequential neural networks using differentiable programming. All modules are programmed in JAX, where automatic differentiation enables gradient back-propagation over the entire model rollout trajectory, allowing the hybrid neural FSI model to be trained as a whole in an end-to-end, sequence-to-sequence manner. Through several FSI benchmark cases, we demonstrate the merit and capability of the proposed method in modeling FSI dynamics for both rigid and flexible bodies. The proposed model has also demonstrated its superiority over baseline purely data-driven neural models, weakly-coupled hybrid neural models, and purely numerical FSI solvers in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.},

  abstract = {The resolution of the Poisson equation is usually one of the most computationally intensive steps for incompressible fluid solvers. Lately, DeepLearning, and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has been introduced to solve this equation, leading to significant inference time reduction at the cost of a lack of guarantee on the accuracy of the solution.This drawback might lead to inaccuracies, potentially unstable simulations and prevent performing fair assessments of the CNN speedup for different network architectures. To circumvent this issue, a hybrid strategy is developed, which couples a CNN with a traditional iterative solver to ensure a user-defined accuracy level. The CNN hybrid method is tested on two flow cases: (a) the flow around a 2D cylinder and (b) the variable-density plumes with and without obstacles (both 2D and 3D), demonstrating remarkable generalization capabilities, ensuring both the accuracy and stability of the simulations. The error distribution of the predictions using several network architectures is further investigated in the plume test case. The introduced hybrid strategy allows a systematic evaluation of the CNN performance at the same accuracy level for various network architectures. In particular, the importance of incorporating multiple scales in the network architecture is demonstrated, since improving both the accuracy and the inference performance compared with feedforward CNN architectures. Thus, in addition to the pure networks' performance evaluation, this study has also led to numerous guidelines and results on how to build neural networks and computational strategies to predict unsteady flows with both accuracy and stability requirements.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluids plays an essential role in modeling many physical phenomena, such as weather, climate, aerodynamics, and plasma physics. Fluids are well described by the Navier--Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10{\texttimes} finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.},

  abstract = {We present an efficient deep learning technique for the model reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations for unsteady flow problems. The proposed technique relies on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the stochastic gradient descent method. Of particular interest is to predict the unsteady fluid forces for different bluff body shapes at low Reynolds number. The discrete convolution process with a nonlinear rectification is employed to approximate the mapping between the bluff-body shape and the fluid forces. The deep neural network is fed by the Euclidean distance function as the input and the target data generated by the full-order Navier-Stokes computations for primitive bluff body shapes. The convolutional networks are iteratively trained using the stochastic gradient descent method with the momentum term to predict the fluid force coefficients of different geometries and the results are compared with the full-order computations. We attempt to provide a physical analogy of the stochastic gradient method with the momentum term with the simplified form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes momentum equation. We also construct a direct relationship between the CNN-based deep learning and the Mori-Zwanzig formalism for the model reduction of a fluid dynamical system. A systematic convergence and sensitivity study is performed to identify the effective dimensions of the deep-learned CNN process such as the convolution kernel size, the number of kernels and the convolution layers. Within the error threshold, the prediction based on our deep convolutional network has a speed-up nearly four orders of magnitude compared to the full-order results and consumes an insignificant fraction of computational resources. The proposed CNN-based approximation procedure has a profound impact on the parametric design of bluff bodies and the feedback control of separated flows.},

A classical neural network, namely, feedforward neural network or sometimes termed multilayer perceptron, is constructed and trained to learn the kinetic LF closure in the static limit and arbitrary mean free path in configuration space. The preliminary relation between best hyperparameters and critical parameters for data generation is found. Compared with the numerical approach (nonFourier method) of the LF closure, the deep learning surrogate model shows an order of magnitude of improvement in terms of accuracy. Perhaps most importantly, the surrogate model closure has been integrated for the first time with fluid simulations. Our DL-enabled fluid simulations, for the first time, give the correct Landau damping rate for a wide range of wave vectors, while the Hammett--Perkins closure cannot produce the correct damping rate. We correctly connect the collisionless Hammett--Perkins closure and collisional Braginskii closure to reproduce the intrinsic nonlocal feature of the heat flux with DL techniques. We address the most concerning error accumulation problem and find that simulations with the deep learning surrogate model are as good as, if not better than, simulations with the analytic closure in terms of long-term numerical stability in the linear Landau damping test.},

  abstract = {Simulation of fluid flow in porous media has many applications, from the micro-scale (cell membranes, filters, rocks) to macro-scale (groundwater, hydrocarbon reservoirs, and geothermal) and beyond. Direct simulation of flow in porous media requires significant computational resources to solve within reasonable timeframes. An integrated method combining predictions of fluid flow (fast, limited accuracy) with direct flow simulation (slow, high accuracy) is outlined. In the tortuous flow paths of porous media, Deep Learning techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are shown to give an accurate estimate of the steady state velocity fields (in all axes), and by extension, the macro-scale permeability. This estimate can be used as-is, or as initial conditions in direct simulation to reach a fully accurate result in a fraction of the compute time. A Gated U-Net Convolutional Neural Network is trained on a datasets of 2D and 3D porous media generated by correlated fields, with their steady state velocity fields calculated from direct LBM simulation. Sensitivity analysis indicates that network accuracy is dependent on (1) the tortuosity of the domain, (2) the size of convolution filters, (3) the use of distance maps as input, (4) the use of mass conservation loss functions. Permeability estimation from these predicted fields reaches over 90{\textbackslash}\% accuracy for 80{\textbackslash}\% of cases. It is further shown that these velocity fields are error prone when used for solute transport simulation. Using the predicted velocity fields as initial conditions is shown to accelerate direct flow simulation to physically true steady state conditions an order of magnitude less compute time. Using Deep Learning predictions (or potentially any other approximation method) to accelerate flow simulation to steady state in complex pore structures shows promise as a technique push the boundaries fluid flow modelling.},

In this paper, we aim to predict turbulent flow by learning its highly nonlinear dynamics from spatiotemporal velocity fields of large-scale fluid flow simulations of relevance to turbulence modeling and climate modeling. We adopt a hybrid approach by marrying two well-established turbulent flow simulation techniques with deep learning. Specifically, we introduce trainable spectral filters in a coupled model of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), followed by a specialized U-net for prediction. Our approach, which we call Turbulent-Flow Net, is grounded in a principled physics model, yet offers the flexibility of learned representations. We compare our model with state-of-the-art baselines and observe significant reductions in error for predictions 60 frames ahead. Most importantly, our method predicts physical fields that obey desirable physical characteristics, such as conservation of mass, whilst faithfully emulating the turbulent kinetic energy field and spectrum, which are critical for accurate prediction of turbulent flows.},
